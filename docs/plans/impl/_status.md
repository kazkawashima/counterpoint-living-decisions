# Implementation status

Updated: 2026-07-19

## Current phase

**M1 Foundation implementation in progress.**

The canonical implementation-facing artifacts are:

- [`docs/specs/README.md`](../../specs/README.md)
- [`docs/plans/README.md`](../README.md)
- [`docs/decisions/user-decisions.md`](../../decisions/user-decisions.md)
- [`docs/decisions/external-rechecks.md`](../../decisions/external-rechecks.md)

## Completed

- Repository preparation and topic import.
- English topic translations.
- Cross-topic authority and conflict resolution.
- Product, domain, security, AI/Realtime, architecture, protocol, UI/evidence,
  operations, testing, and submission specs.
- Topic and topic-14 section coverage matrices.
- Ordered M0–M6 delivery plan.
- User-decision list separated from external fact rechecks.
- F1 npm workspace scaffold with pinned Node/npm versions.
- Root format, lint, typecheck, unit/contract/integration, build, development,
  and deployment-smoke command surface.
- Vite development and preview host binding to `0.0.0.0`.
- Secret-safe environment-example validation.
- Enforced domain/package dependency boundaries with deliberate failing
  fixtures.

## In progress

- F2 protocol primitives and versioned envelopes.
- F3–F5 domain entities, event reducers, and Decision lifecycle.
- F6 ports and reusable contract harnesses.

## Not started

- Runtime adapters, UI, deployment, and submission assets.

## Next executable slice

Continue [`01-foundation-domain-and-contracts.md`](../01-foundation-domain-and-contracts.md)
with F2 protocol primitives, then complete the deterministic F3–F6 domain
foundation. Do not start optional scenarios.

## Open gates

- Closed: UD-01 Work & Productivity, UD-03 USD 25/day judge cap, and UD-06
  explicitly labeled demo-story treatment.
- Partially closed: UD-02 public at submission; final project license awaits
  dependency/submission audit.
- Provisional: UD-04 continues Counterpoint pending name clearance.
- Open: UD-05 final message hierarchy and UD-07 credential path.
- ER-07 preview inspection is scheduled for 2026-07-20.
- External rechecks are performed at their named implementation/submission
  gates.
