# Implementation status

Updated: 2026-07-19

## Current phase

**M1 Foundation complete; M2 local skeleton is in progress.**

The canonical implementation-facing artifacts are:

- [`docs/specs/README.md`](../../specs/README.md)
- [`docs/plans/README.md`](../README.md)
- [`docs/decisions/user-decisions.md`](../../decisions/user-decisions.md)
- [`docs/decisions/external-rechecks.md`](../../decisions/external-rechecks.md)

## Completed

- Repository preparation and topic import.
- English topic translations.
- Cross-topic authority and conflict resolution.
- Product, domain, security, AI/Realtime, architecture, protocol, UI/evidence,
  operations, testing, and submission specs.
- Topic and topic-14 section coverage matrices.
- Ordered M0–M6 delivery plan.
- User-decision list separated from external fact rechecks.
- F1 npm workspace scaffold with pinned Node/npm versions.
- Root format, lint, typecheck, unit/contract/integration, build, development,
  and deployment-smoke command surface.
- Vite development and preview host binding to `0.0.0.0`.
- Secret-safe environment-example validation.
- Enforced domain/package dependency boundaries with deliberate failing
  fixtures.
- F2 protocol primitives, private/shared event envelopes, version/upcast policy,
  stable errors, and deep secret/private-data redaction.
- F3 flagship domain entities and construction invariants.
- F4 all 37 required event payloads, deterministic projections, replay,
  idempotency, optimistic concurrency, owner isolation, and scoped reset.
- F5 complete Decision transition matrix, human-confirmed review boundary,
  Action hold, revisions, and reconsideration task behavior.
- F6 all required ports, authorization/command/query boundaries, reusable
  EventStore/ProjectionStore/ArtifactStore/RealtimePublisher contracts, and
  test-only in-memory adapters.
- Deterministic M1 integration journey through `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, held Action,
  and reconsideration task with equivalent shared-only replay.
- L1 SQLite migrations, meeting-scoped event/projection adapters, partitioned
  local artifact storage, reusable adapter contracts, and restart coverage.
- L2 fixed-user password hashing, persisted Bearer sessions, inactivity and
  absolute expiry, meeting creation, 3–8 assignments, assigned list, and code
  join application boundaries.
- Strict v1 HTTP DTOs for the planned local flagship capability surface,
  including health/readiness contracts.
- Local Hono startup on `0.0.0.0`, fixed five-user and flagship-meeting seed,
  versioned identity/meeting routes, safe errors, correlation IDs, and
  secret-free health/readiness.
- React login, assigned-meeting list, code fallback, and responsive
  participant-private/shared workspace shell with tab-scoped session storage.
- Browser E2E for desktop, mobile, reduced motion, external-host-style access,
  and safe authentication failure, with six screenshots and one reel clip.
- Deterministic disclosure application core through owner-private source,
  proposal, editable preview, hash revalidation, approval/rejection, and
  shared Evidence publication. Complete projections remain owner-partitioned.

## In progress

- Expose the deterministic disclosure core through versioned HTTP and connect
  the live participant workspace.
- Complete the facilitator, shared-display, history, and audit role surfaces.

## Not started

- Realtime application hub and resume.
- Deployment and remaining submission assets.

## Next executable slice

Complete [`02-local-flagship-skeleton.md`](../02-local-flagship-skeleton.md)
L5 disclosure HTTP/UI vertical slice, preserving the owner/shared projection
partition. Do not start optional scenarios.

## Open gates

- Closed: UD-01 Work & Productivity, UD-03 USD 25/day judge cap, and UD-06
  explicitly labeled demo-story treatment.
- Partially closed: UD-02 public at submission; final project license awaits
  dependency/submission audit.
- Provisional: UD-04 continues Counterpoint pending name clearance.
- Open: UD-05 final message hierarchy and UD-07 credential path.
- ER-07 preview inspection is scheduled for 2026-07-20.
- External rechecks are performed at their named implementation/submission
  gates.
